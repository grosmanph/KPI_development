Aug 20, 2021


** challenge_data.csv **

The file challenge_data.csv contains data collected by sensors in a rig during a tripping out operation. We expect that the data has a sample rate of 2 samples per second.

The file has the following columns:
* index: timestamp in ms
* BDEP: bit depth in m
* TPO: fluid flow in gpm
* HL: hook load in klbf
* BHT: block position in m
* RPM: rotary speed in rpm
* TOR: torque in klbf-ft
* DEPT: hole depth in m
* WOB: weight on bit in klbf


** challenge_annotation.csv **

The file challenge_annotation.csv contains annotated data on the classification change points, i.e., the timestamp of an 'off_slips' annotation marks the beggining of the 'off_slips' state, it remains unchanges until the timestamp of the next annotation.

The file has the following columns:
* index: timestamp in ms
* Annotation: annotations
